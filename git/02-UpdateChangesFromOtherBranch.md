# Update **mybranch** with the latest changes from **develop** branch.

## Step 1: Ensure Local Repository is Up-to-Date

You should ensure to have the latest **develop** branch updates from the remote repository.

```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop  # Get the latest updates from remote
```

## Step 2: Update your Branch (mybranch)

You need to rebase or merge develop into `mybranch`.

### Option 1: Rebase (Preferred)

Rebasing applies develop's changes on top of `mybranch`, keeping the history clean.

```bash
git checkout mybranch
git rebase develop  # Replay changes on top of develop
```

If there are conflicts:

- Git will pause and ask you to resolve them.
- Use git status to see the files with conflicts.
- Edit the files and remove conflict markers (<<<<<<, ======, >>>>>>).
- After resolving, stage them:

```bash
git add .
git rebase --continue
```

- If you want to abort the rebase:

```bash
git rebase --abort
```

### Option 2: Merge (Easier but Messier)

Alternatively, you can merge `develop` into `mybranch`:

```bash
git checkout mybranch
git merge develop
```

If conflicts occur:

- Edit the conflicting files.
- Stage the resolved files:

```bash
git add .
```

- Complete the merge:

```bash
git commit -m "Merged develop into mybranch"
```
