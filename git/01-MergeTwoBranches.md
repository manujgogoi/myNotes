# Merge Two Remote branches to a local branch

In a Git and GitHub collaborative development workflow, especially in teams, following best practices ensures that everyone can contribute efficiently and the project remains maintainable. Let's break down your specific scenario and then give a general collaborative workflow.

## Scenario 1 Breakdown

1. **Private Repository**: The repository is private, so only the team members (a, b, c, d) can access it.
2. **Team**: **a** is the owner of the repo, and the team consists of 4 members: a, b, c, and d.
3. **Branches Created**: Both a and b have created separate branches (_abranch_ and _bbranch_), and they have made several changes on their respective branches.
4. **Merge and Conflict Resolution**: One of the admins (any team member) will now need to merge the two branches, and conflicts might occur.

### How to Handle Merging with Conflicts

1. **Admin Merging the Branches**:

- First, **a** and **b** should push their changes to their respective branches if not already done.
- Admin will then checkout the branch they want to merge into (usually the **main** or **develop** branch).
- The admin can then run:

```bash
git checkout main  # or develop branch
git pull origin main  # Make sure it's up-to-date
git merge abranch    # Merge the first branch
git merge bbranch    # Try merging the second branch
```

2. **Conflict Resolution**:

- If there are conflicts (Git will tell you which files have conflicts), the admin will need to open the conflicted files and manually resolve them.
- Once resolved, mark the conflicts as resolved by:

```bash
git add <conflicted_files>
git commit   # Commit the resolved changes
```

3. **Optional: Test Branch**:

- Creating a testbranch before merging into main is not strictly required, but it is a good practice. It allows the admin to test the merged code and ensure everything works before pushing it to **main** or **develop**.
- Admin can do this by:

```bash
git checkout -b testbranch
git merge abranch
git merge bbranch
# Test and ensure everything works
git checkout main  # or develop
git merge testbranch
```

### Pull Remote branch to a local branch

To pull a remote branch into your local branch **develop**, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure you're on the `develop` branch**: First, make sure you're on the develop branch by running:

```bash
git checkout develop
```

2. **Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository**: This ensures you have the most up-to-date information about all remote branches.

```bash
git fetch origin
```

3. **Pull the `other_branch` into `develop`**: Now, you can pull the changes from `other_branch` into your `develop` branch:

```bash
git pull origin other_branch
```

This will merge other_branch into your develop branch.

4. **Resolve any conflicts (if necessary)**: If there are merge conflicts, Git will notify you. You'll need to manually resolve the conflicts in the affected files and then commit the changes:

```bash
git add <conflicted_files>
git commit  # Commit the resolved changes
```

### Alternatively, if you prefer to merge the remote branch manually:

1. Checkout to `develop` (if not already):

```bash
git checkout develop
```

2. Fetch remote branches:

```bash
git fetch origin
```

3. Merge `other_branch` into `develop`:

```bash
git merge origin/other_branch
```

4. **Handle any conflicts and commit**: If there are any conflicts, resolve them and commit the changes.
