# Best Collaborative Development Workflow

Here’s a **recommended Git workflow** that is **safe**, **secure**, **transparent**, and **maintainable**:

## 1. **Branching Strategy**:

- **Main** (or **Master**): This is the stable production branch. It should always contain **_deployable code_**.
- **Develop**: This is where features are integrated. It’s the branch for development, and features should be merged here once they are stable.
- **Feature Branches**: Each team member works on their own feature branch (`feature/a`, `feature/b`, etc.) based on the `develop` branch. When the feature is complete, they will create a Pull Request (PR).
- **Bugfix Branches**: Any critical bug or hotfixes should be handled in a separate branch (`hotfix/bug-name`) based on `main`.

## 2. Pull Requests (PRs):

- Always create **Pull Requests** from feature branches to `develop` or `main` (depending on your workflow).
- PRs should be reviewed by at least one other team member to ensure code quality and avoid introducing errors.
- Use `descriptive commit messages` and PR descriptions.

## 3. Merging:

- **Merge PRs**: Once the PR is reviewed, the admin (or any designated team member) merges the PR into the target branch.
- Always use the `Squash and Merge` option in GitHub to keep the commit history clean.

## 4. Continuous Integration (CI):

- **Set up a CI pipeline** (e.g., **GitHub Actions**, **CircleCI**, **Jenkins**) to run automated tests every time a PR is created or updated. This ensures that the code doesn’t break the build and passes all tests.

## 5. Code Reviews:

- Implement a **code review** process where team members review each other's code. This helps catch bugs, improve code quality, and maintain consistency in the codebase.

## 6. Feature Toggles:

- For large features that might take a long time to finish, consider using **feature toggles**. This allows you to merge incomplete features into the develop branch while ensuring they don’t affect the production environment.

## 7. Branch Protection:

- Use **branch protection** rules to ensure that the `main` or `develop` branch can’t be pushed to directly.
- Require that all PRs have at least one review, and CI checks must pass before merging.

## 8. Commit Frequency:

- Commit frequently with small, logical changes. This makes it easier to merge and reduces conflicts.
- Avoid large commits that change many files.

## 9. Rebase Feature Branches:

- **Rebase** feature branches regularly (at least once before merging them into `develop` or `main`) to keep them up to date with the latest changes in the base branch.
- This helps avoid many merge conflicts and keeps history clean.
- You can do this by:

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout feature/a
git rebase origin/develop
```

## 10. Keep Your Branches Short-Lived:

- Feature branches should be short-lived, and the team should aim to merge them into the mainline (`develop`) quickly to avoid complex merges.
