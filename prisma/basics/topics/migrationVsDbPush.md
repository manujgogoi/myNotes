# `npx prisma db push` vs `npx prisma migrate`

Both `npx prisma db push` and `npx prisma migrate` are used to apply database schema changes when working with Prisma, but they serve different purposes. Here's a comparison:

---

## 🔹 `npx prisma db push`

- **Purpose:** Synchronizes the Prisma schema (`schema.prisma`) with the database **without creating a migration history**.
- **Use Case:** Useful in **development and prototyping** when you want quick updates to your database schema.
- **Effect:**
  - Directly updates the database schema based on your Prisma model.
  - Does **not** create migration files.
  - Does **not** provide rollback support.
  - Works well for rapid iterations but can cause issues in production.

**Example:**

```sh
npx prisma db push
```

✅ Best for:

- Local development
- Rapid schema updates without tracking history
- Testing new changes quickly

🚫 Avoid in:

- Production environments
- When you need version-controlled migrations

## 🔹 `npx prisma migrate`

- **Purpose**: Generates migration files and applies them in a structured and version-controlled way.
- **Use Case**: Best for **production-ready** schema changes where tracking and rollback support are needed.
- **Effect**: - Creates a new migration file inside `prisma/migrations/`.
  - Ensures schema changes are properly tracked in version control.
  - Allows rolling back changes if needed.

Example: 1️⃣ Create a migration file:

```sh
npx prisma migrate dev --name my_migration
```

2️⃣ Apply migrations to the database:

```sh
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

✅ Best for:

- Tracking schema changes over time
- Collaborative projects where schema history matters

🚫 Avoid when:

- You just want a quick schema update without tracking history (use `db push` instead).
