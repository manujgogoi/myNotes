## Definition

- Mobile UI Framework for creating native apps for iOS and Android
- Single codebase (dart) means we only have to write our app once for multiple devices.

## Why use Flutter

- Only 1 code-base
- Good layout methodology
- Good layout methodology borrowed from responsive web
- Very smooth and quick experience when running apps
- Works well with Firebase as a backend
- Uses Dart, which is a really easy language to pick up.
- Uses Material Design out-of-the-box
- Great docs & guides on the Flutter website

## Flutter Overview

### Widgets, Widgets and only Widgets

- Text Widget
- Button Widget
- Row Widget
- Column Widget
- Image Widget
  lots more...

Widgets are fully customizable. They have properties. We can pass values to those properties for any changes.

Widgets are in flutter ares classes. Each widget has its own programmatic class which defines its behavior and how it looks on the screen.

Flutter uses Dart as the programming language to create apps.

## Dart

### Built-in types

- Numbers (int, double)
- Strings (String)
- Booleans (bool)
- Records ((value1, value2))
- Lists (List, also known as arrays)
- Sets (Set)
- Maps (Map)
- Runes (Runes; often replaced by the characters API)
- Symbols (Symbol)
- The value null (Null)

### Some other types also have special roles in the Dart language:

- Object: The superclass of all Dart classes except Null.
- Enum: The superclass of all enums.
- Future and Stream: Used in asynchrony support.
- Iterable: Used in for-in loops and in synchronous generator functions.
- Never: Indicates that an expression can never successfully finish evaluating. Most often used for functions that always throw an exception.
- dynamic: Indicates that you want to disable static checking. Usually you should use Object or Object? instead.
- void: Indicates that a value is never used. Often used as a return type.
